## Code of Conduct

As a W3C Community Group, the OWPA operates under the W3C's [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).

### Statement of Intent

W3C is committed to maintain a **positive** work environment. This commitment calls for a workplace where [participants][Participant] at all
levels **behave** according to the rules of the following code. A foundational concept of this code is that **we all share responsibility**
for our [work environment][Work].

### Code

 1. Treat each other with [respect][], professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency.
 1. Never [harass][Harassment] or [bully][Workplace] anyone verbally, physically or [sexually][Sexual].
 1. Never [discriminate][Discrimination] on the basis of personal characteristics or group membership.
 1. Communicate constructively and avoid [demeaning][] or [insulting][] behavior or language.
 1. Seek, accept, and offer objective work criticism, and [acknowledge][Acknowledgement] properly the contributions of others.
 1. Be honest about your own qualifications, and about any circumstances that might lead to [conflicts of interest][].
 1. Respect the [privacy][Confidentiality] of others and the [confidentiality][] of data you access.
 1. With respect to cultural differences, be conservative in what you do and liberal in what you accept from others, but not to the point of accepting disrespectful, unprofessional or unfair behavior.
 1. Promote the rules of this Code and take action (especially if you are in a [leadership position][Leadership]) to bring the discussion back to a more civil level whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed.
